# Global and system settings

Settings are available at two levels in Retool: global and system.

* **Global settings** are applied to every DAT Retool processes, so long as system
  settings don't override them.

* **System settings** are applied to a specific system named in a DAT file. For example,
  you can have settings for just the _Sony - PlayStation_ DAT file from Redump.
  [System settings](how-to-use-retool-gui-system-settings.md) mostly mirror what's
  available in the global settings, although there are some unique features.
