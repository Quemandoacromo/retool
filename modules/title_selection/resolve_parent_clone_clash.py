    """
    Makes sure a title isn't assigned as both a parent and a clone. This can only
    happen when exporting a DAT in legacy mode.

    This is usually caused by duplicate entries in a clone list.

    The solution is simple: if any title is marked as a parent, but happens to also
    marked as a clone, remove its clone status.

    Args:
        processed_titles (dict[str, set[DatNode]]): A work in progress dictionary
        of DatNodes, originally populated from the input DAT and actively being worked
        on by Retool.

        config (Config): The Retool config object.

    Returns:
        dict[str, set[DatNode]]: A dictionary of DatNodes that have had parent/clone
        errors corrected.
